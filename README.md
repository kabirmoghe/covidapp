# Live County COVID-19 Data
Code for a web app that provides information on county-level COVID-19 information. 

This web app allows you to explore the current month's COVID-19 infection rate across 90% of counties in the United States. The data used is compiled from USAFacts.org (the source for the CDC's COVID-19 statistics), USDA, and AARP. The data on the COVID-19 Pandemic includes monthly information on cases and deaths as well as infection rate and mortality rate. The application incorporates a 7-day lag in the used COVID-19 data in order to prevent errors in the data sources from affecting the calculated rates though these errors are usually fixed within days. Along with information on COVID-19, the app includes several other county attributes that may be relevant to the spread of the virus: median household income, unemployment, education, race demographics, and the presence of a statewide mask requirements. All of these attributes are up-to-date, and the mask-requirements are updated almost daily.
